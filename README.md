# AI_8_Puzzle_Search_Algorithms

A version of the 8-puzzle game, in the 3x3 version there are 9 tiles from 1 to 9, and 1 to 16 in the 4x4.
Each tile needs to be in its goal position in order for the puzzle to be solved.
The rules are: only switch 2 tile at a time, vertically or horizontally. 
For this puzzle we were tasked to implement 3 different algorithms:
1. Iterative Deepening - run a DFS by increasing level of depth, assuming the goal would be in a certain depth.
2. Breath First Search - iterate on the state tree level by level, searching for the goal.
3. A Star - Use Heuristic to decide which step in the state tree is the optimal.

the following explanation is in the PDF file that was part of the assignment:
